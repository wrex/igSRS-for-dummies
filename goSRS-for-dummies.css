  /* 
   * Visually hide the "forgot" and "easy" buttons on review screens. 
   *
   * This user style makes the "hard" and "good" buttons **MUCH** more prominent
   * on the review screens, making it a simple binary decision most of the time.
   * If you know the answer right away, click "good", otherwise, click "hard".
   *
   * "New" reviews only have three buttons ("not yet" and "got it").  Reviews of
   * items you've seen before have 5 buttons all in the same div: "forgot",
   * "hard", "good", "easy", and "more...".
   *
   * The "forgot" and "easy" buttons are still there if you need them, they are
   * just near-invisible until you hover on them. Click "forgot" if you've
   * completely forgotten something and want to start over. Click "easy" if it
   * was egregiously easy and you don't want to see it again for as long as
   * possible.
